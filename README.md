# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

This is an analysis about the mpg of MechaCar prototypes by using R.
The data sets ![MechaCar_mpg.csv](resources/MechaCar_mpg.csv) and ![Suspension_Coil.csv](resources/Suspension_Coil.csv) were used for this analysis.

## Outlines

A ultiple linear regression analysis were performed to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes. Summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots was collected. t-tests was run to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population. And finally,a statistical study was designed to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

In aeach of these four analysis the results were reported in this document.
